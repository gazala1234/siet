            Engineering education has entered a new era. India has become a signatory of the Washington accord. Hence we must adopt Outcome Based Education and see that our students inculcate the Graduate attributes of an engineer. Outcome Based Education has shifted the focus of education from teacher-centric to student-centric one i.e., a student should achieve the goals of education.
            <span class="hidden-xs"> The twelve graduate attributes of an engineer are knowledge base, problem analysis, investigation, design, tools, individual & team work, communication skill, professionalism, society & environmental impact, ethics & equality, economics & project management, and lifelong learning.
                Your Success is our Goal. The basic objective of our institution is to provide quality education and we would like to adopt the latest technological advancements relevant to the education field in all of our institutions in the future.</span>
