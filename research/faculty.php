    <h4>Faculty Research Program</h4>
    <h6 class="mt-4">Research @ SECAB I.E.T</h6>
    <p>To foster the Research activities in all the Research centres, SECAB Institute of Engineering and Technology has made a humble beginning during the academic year 2015-16 by establishing interdisciplinary Research cell under the guidance of Dr.M.K.Rabinal, Professor, Dept. of Physics, Karnataka University, Dharwad.</p>
    <p>Focus of this program is to develop Research culture amongst faculty to give a boost to cutting edge Research in state of art technologies. Under this program centralized meetings are conducted involving the active faculty researchers to assess the progress of Research activities at the department level. The adorable results obtained include</p>
    <p>i. Research proposals are submitted to various funding agencies.</p>
    <p>ii. VTU has approved Research centres for Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Physics and Computer Science and Engineering during the academic year 2018-19.</p>
    <p>iii. - Overall 20 faculty were registered for Ph. D Programme.</p>
